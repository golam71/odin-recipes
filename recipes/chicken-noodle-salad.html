      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha chile sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon hoisin sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 cooked chicken breast</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 cup grated carrots</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>4 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped roasted, salted peanuts</li>
      <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh basil</li>

      <li>⅓ cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol style="width: 350px">
      <li>
        Whisk garlic, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar,
        Sriracha, hoisin, and sesame oil together in a mixing bowl for the
        dressing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tear chicken apart into strands similar in width to the spaghetti.
        Refrigerate until ready to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer spaghetti to a mixing bowl; add the chicken, carrots, bell
        pepper, and green onions. Pour in the dressing and toss by hand until
        well combined. Seal the surface of the salad with plastic wrap and
        refrigerate, tossing occasionally, for 2 to 12 hours, the longer the
        better.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add peanuts, basil, mint, and cilantro to the salad. Toss well; taste
        and adjust for seasoning.
      </li>
    </ol>
