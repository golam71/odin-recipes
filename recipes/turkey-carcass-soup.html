    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 picked-over turkey carcass</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups leftover stuffing</li>
      <li>1 onion, peeled and diced</li>
      <li>2 carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
      <li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon poultry seasoning</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground sage</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>2 ½ quarts chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 cup water, or as needed (Optional)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>ground black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups (uncooked) regular long-grain white rice</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen green peas</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place turkey carcass in a large, deep pot. Add stuffing, onion, carrots,
        celery, poultry seasoning, sage, and bay leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in chicken broth. Add additional water if needed to cover. Bring to
        a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, skimming
        off any foam, for about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove carcass and any bones. Pick any meat off carcass and bones.
        Return meat to the pot and discard bones and skin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season soup with garlic salt and pepper. Stir in rice and return to a
        boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in peas and continue to simmer until rice is tender, about 10
        minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>Adjust seasonings to taste before serving.</li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
